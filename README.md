# dev_rules!
- each arch is located in src/arch
- develop a macro called arch_init and a function called init for an arch in mod.rs

# goals!
- arch: arm, arm64, x86_64
- being able to run wasm binaries
- being able to run native binaries
- being as minimal, as lightweight and as usable as possible
- cool os to teach me about oses!
